# Unit-4-game - Crystal Collector

This is a number guessing game where the user must reach an equal value number as the computer displayed number.
The computer generates a random number which is displayed on the left
There are 4 crystals displayed, all with random hidden values (1-12)
The user must click on a crystal in order to display the "user total score" 
By clicking on the different crystals, the user total score increases by the value set to that specific crystal. 
If the user's total score is equal to the computer random number, the user wins, the game restarts, and a point is added to the 'wins' score
If the user's total score is over the computer's random number, the user losses, the game restarts, and a point is added to the 'losses' score
At the start of every new game (reset), the computer generates a new random number that is displayed and all 4 crystals are reset with new hidden values. Each game generates new values
